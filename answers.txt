1.What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
Gitignore file commands git to ignore certain files while committing to a project in the GitHub repository.
For a java project there are certain files that we could ignore which include .class, .template, .project, etc.

2.What does fast-forward in git mean?
If there aren’t any changes in other branches one could directly merge the changes made in a branch with the master/main sequentially.

3.Why should you have different branches?
Branches are used to create independent workspaces among teammates which do not affect the main code while developing and can be merged to the main code after testing.

4.In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
The number of repositories depends on the scale of the project. If it is a small project one remote repository would be enough. But if the scale of the project is big then we can have many repository depending on the team’s choice.
